Mesh properties
===============

Some of the other useful properties of a ``mesh`` object, besides its
main list properties ``node``, ``column``, ``layer`` and ``cell``,
are:

* ``num_nodes``, ``num_columns``, ``num_layers``, ``num_cells``:
  numbers of nodes, columns, layers and cells in the mesh
* ``area``: horizontal area occupied by the mesh
* ``centre``: horizontal centre of the mesh
* ``bounds``: horizontal bounding rectangle around the mesh
* ``volume``: total volume occupied by the mesh cells
* ``surface_cells``: list of cells at the top surface of the mesh
