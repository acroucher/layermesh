Layermesh is a library for creating and manipulating computational meshes with a layer/column structure, i.e. the mesh has a (possibly unstructured) horizontal 2-D mesh projected down through a series of layers of constant thickness.

The mesh may optionally have a non-horizontal surface, for example to represent ground surface topography, created by removing cells from the upper layers of each column.
